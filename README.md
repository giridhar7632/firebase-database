# Firebase Database

Have you ever created database for a web applications? In this workshop we are going to create a realtime database using google's Firebase for our web application. We are going to build something like this.

![Final Project](https://cloud-3a2lu9qq3.vercel.app/2screenshot_2020-11-09_163829.png)

[Live Demo](https://firebase-database.giridharhackclu.repl.co/).  [Source Code](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/firebase-database#src/App.js).

Everytime you submit the form, the input given will be updated to a realtime database.

## Prerequisites

![Prerequisites](https://cloud-l2ccvbjwj.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-09_213901.png)

You should have some intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also some fundamentals of React and React-Hooks.

## Getting started

### Database

![Database](https://cloud-l2ccvbjwj.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-09_220807.png)

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.

There are many technologies like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and more to create database.

### Database as a service

![Database as a service](https://cloud-l2ccvbjwj.vercel.app/2screenshot_2020-11-09_221151.png)

Database as a service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing managed service offering that provides access to a database without requiring the setup of physical hardware, the installation of software or the need to configure the database. 

### Firebase

<img src="https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/5firebase_realtime_database__1-_icon__dark_.png" alt="Firebase REaltime Database" width="200px" height="auto"/>

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. We can store and sync data across all clients in realtime, and remains available when your app goes offline. 

> Realtime means : Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Realtime Database uses data synchronizationâ€”every time data changes, any connected device receives that update within milliseconds. Provide collaborative and immersive experiences without thinking about networking code.

In this workshop, we will create a form, which stores data into firebase realtime database, when submitted, using [React](https://reactjs.org). 

## Setting up..

### Code editor

We will be using [Repl.it](https://repl.it) for building our project. Repl.it is a online code editor, where you can code in many different languages without any installations.

Fork this starter repl [here](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/firebase-database-starter). It contains a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) installed. The starter-template contains all the styles required, so that we can concentrate on React and Firebase. Click the `RUN` button to check your template. You should see something like this.

![Repl](https://cloud-3a2lu9qq3.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-09_160050.png)

If you prefer to use local code-editor install both of them manually through terminal.

```javascript
npx create-react-app firebase-database
// after installation
cd firebase-database
npm install --save firebase
```

### Creating Firebase project

You can access [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with your [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/). After signing in, click the `Go to console`  on top right corner.

![Firebase](https://cloud-m3srogzel.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_101346.png)

Then in your console, If you don't have any projects yet, it will be clean and empty. Click on `Create project` to add a new project.

![Console](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-09_222607.png)

Complete all the steps to create a firebase project. Name your project as you wish.

![Step-1](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-09_222741.png)

Here is an optional step where you can use Google Analytics for your project, but in this workshop, you won't need it. After giving a name to your project click the continue button to proceed further.

![Step-2](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/4screenshot_2020-11-09_224518.png)

If you use Google Analytics for your project, then configure it to `Default Account for Firebase`.

![Step-3](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/2screenshot_2020-11-09_223126.png)

Click on `Continue` to finsh setting up your project. After project was created you will see something like this.

![Project setup](https://cloud-axyxh81oj.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_122542.png)

Then hop on to repl.it and start coding.

## Part-1

### Create a form

Now we are going to create a form to get the input from the user. Now we can say that forms in HTML are slightly different from that are in React. The form elements like `<input />`, `<select />`, `<textarea />` are responsible on their own to handle the user input and update their respective values. But in React, the forms are controlled by components using `state`. Learn more about React forms [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).

Go to `App.js` file, and create a `<form>`  with two `<input>` elements for Name and Email along with label, and a `Submit` button.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email" />
        </label>
        <button> Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Click `Run` button and check your output. All the styles are prewritten. Don't wonder to see this output.

### Handling the form

Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.

In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM. In React, form data is usually handled by the components.

When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state. You can control changes by adding event handlers in the `onChange` attribute.

Let's create two state variables each for name and email. Now add an event handler in the `onChange` attribute, and let the event handler update the state everytime you enter a letter. Also create `handleName` and `handleEmail` for updating values of respective inputs.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")

  // for handling name
  function handleName(e) {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }
  // for handling email
  function handleEmail(e) {
    setEmail(e.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name} 
          onChange={handleName} 
          placeholder="Your Name" 
        />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input 
          type="email" 
          value={email} 
          onChange={handleEmail}
          placeholder="Your Email" 
        />
        </label>
        <button> Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Submitting Forms

You can control the submit action by adding an event handler in the `onSubmit` attribute. After submitting, we will dispaly a message for 3 seconds. Create a state variable to track the whether the form is submitted or not. Also create a function `handleSubmit` and call it inside `onSubmit` attribute of button.

```javascript
const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false)

function handleSubmit(e){
    setSubmitted(true)
    console.log(name, email, submitted)
    setName("")
    setEmail("")
    setTimeout(() => {
      setSubmitted(false)
    }, 3000)
    e.preventDefault()
  }

<button onClick={handleSubmit} > Submit </button>
```

<details>
<summary>The final `App.js` so far looks like.</summary>
  
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false)

  function handleName(e) {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }
  function handleEmail(e) {
    setEmail(e.target.value)
  }
  function handleSubmit(e){
    setSubmitted(true)
    console.log(name, email, submitted)
    setName("")
    setEmail("")
    setTimeout(() => {
      setSubmitted(false)
    }, 3000)
    e.preventDefault()
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        {submitted ? <p className="result"> Successfully submitted !!</p> : null}
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name} 
          onChange={handleName} 
          placeholder="Your Name" 
        />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input 
          type="email" 
          value={email} 
          onChange={handleEmail}
          placeholder="Your Email" 
        />
        </label>
        <button onClick={handleSubmit} > Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
</details>

Click `Run` button and check the output. Let's first `console.log` the value of inputs. If you get the value of inputs in the console, then you are good to go.

![Submitting data](https://cloud-d4dcm2tr0.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-gif-maker__6_.gif)

Upto now we created a form with which we can add data to our database.

That means front-end part completed. 

![Good job](https://cloud-ac5q22xg1.vercel.app/0good_job.gif)

## Part-2

### Creating Database

Now open the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) you left before and open the current project folder. We can use firebase for different platforms. But for now, we are going to use it for `web(</>)`. Click on `</>` button. You will see something like this.

![Console](https://cloud-j3vz1auk3.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-gif-maker__7_.gif)

Then give your app a name. I'm going to give this name.

![Add name](https://cloud-4zt4ppz2y.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_145514.png)

Click on `continue`. Then you will get `Firebase SDK` data. Every user have their own `API` key and Id. Copy the code in the `<script>`. This contains the data to access your firebase.

### Configuring Project with Firebase

Then hop on to your `repl` and create a new file in `src` folder and name it as `Firebase.js`. Then import the `firebase` module, which is already installed and paste the data you copied in firebase. Your `Firebase.js` file will be like this with your information.

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase'

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAcg8MxG_vX65Vfh2fAoH9tuyHUn85JqNQ",
  authDomain: "test-form-f2df9.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://test-form-f2df9.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "test-form-f2df9",
  storageBucket: "test-form-f2df9.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "684489897467",
  appId: "1:684367456467:web:7fff9d88d6accf5426ae0e",
  measurementId: "G-YV81RWDHS5"
};

var fireBase = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
export default fireBase
```

This is for configuring firebase with our React project. Now let's create a realtime database on firebase. Go back to to your firebase console and click the `Realtime Database` on the sidebar.

![Sidebar](https://cloud-2zamqusnb.vercel.app/0screenshot__3__li.jpg)

Then Click on `Create Database`.

![Create Database](https://cloud-4zhtbdxo9.vercel.app/0screenshot__4__li.jpg)

Make sure you create it in `Test Mode`.

![Test Mode](https://cloud-bugaglghj.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_153651.png)

Then your realtime database will be initiated with `null`(means, nothing in it).

![Database](https://cloud-bugaglghj.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-10_153751.png)

The rules here are important. Initially firebase allows anyone to read and write data in database upto 30 days. You can change the settings at any time in the `Rules` tab.

Now we created the database and configured it with our project. Then let's add data through the form.
